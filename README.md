# 3D Reconstruction with Fringe Pattern

### 3D Reconstruction Project via Fringe Pattern Projection conducted in a Research Paper Course, Yonsei University (MATLAB R2023b)

Fringe projection profilometry has been thoroughly investigated in the field of 3D reconstruction. To increase the accuracy of fringe projection profilometry using lots of phase shifted, short period, single fringe pattern is recommended. However I tried to reconstruct an object with only seven pictures.
